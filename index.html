                    My name is Sameer Raj Shekhar, and I am truly honored to be here today. I come before you as an individual who thrives on challenges, embraces learning, and is deeply passionate about working in your company. With a solid academic foundation, including an impressive 86 percent in my 10th standard and an 82 percent in the 12th standard, I have cultivated a strong work ethic and a commitment to achieving excellence in every endeavor.
                    
                    What sets me apart is  not just my academic achievements, but my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations and my unwavering dedication to continuous improvement. Over the years, I have honed my skills in devlopment, and I am eager to contribute my talents to delloit. I am confident that my combination of academic achievements, practical skills, and a genuine passion for devlopment make me a valuable candidate for the devloper role.
                    
                    Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the vision and goals of delloit. I look forward to the conversation ahead.
